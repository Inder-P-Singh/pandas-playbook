# Pandas Playbook

This repository contains the Pandas Playbook, designed for data analysts and ML engineers (Beginner → Intermediate) to master essential Pandas operations.

## Features
-   **Reproducible Python Programs**: Step-by-step guides for data loading, cleaning, transformation, and visualization.
-   **Sample Data**: Small, synthetic CSV files for hands-on practice.
-   **Utility Scripts**: Examples for running basic data checks and generating reports outside of Programs.
-   **Automated Tests**: A Pytest suite to verify core functionalities and generated outputs.
-   **Comprehensive Playbook**: A markdown guide (`playbook.md`) covering concepts, lab exercises, and next steps.

## Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Inder-P-Singh/pandas-playbook.git
    cd pandas-playbook
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment** (recommended):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\\Scripts\\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install Required Packages**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Playbook

### 1. Run Quick Tests
Ensure that you are in the repo root (pandas-playbook folder). Verify your setup and data integrity with a lightweight script:
```bash
python scripts/run_quick_tests.py
# Expected output: ALL_CHECKS_PASS
```

### 2. Open Python Programs
Ensure your virtual environment is activated before running Python scripts. Ensure that you are in the repo root (pandas-playbook folder).
```bash
python programs/01_quickstart_basic.py
python programs/02_cleaning_and_dtypes.py
python programs/03_groupby_merge_pivot.py
python programs/04_time_series_and_resample.py
```
Open the Programs in numerical order (e.g., `01_quickstart_basic.py`, `02_cleaning_and_dtypes.py`, etc.). Each program includes commented explanations and code to execute. Outputs generated by Programs will be saved in the `outputs/` directory.

### 3. Explore Utility Scripts
Run example scripts to see how to perform common tasks outside of Jupyter:
```bash
python scripts/example_report.py
```
This will generate `outputs/aggregated_report.csv` and `outputs/aggregated_plot_script.png`.

## Outputs
All generated CSVs and plots from Programs and scripts will be saved in the `outputs/` directory. Each program also produces a `verification_<program>.json` file in `outputs/` containing checksums or counts for automated checks.

## Learn More
For a detailed guide, dive into the `playbook.md` file located in the root directory.
